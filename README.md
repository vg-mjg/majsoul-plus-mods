# How to install (pls improve)

1. Check what kind of mod is it. Is it an **extension** or a **resource pack**. To check, open the mod folder. If there's an extension.json, it's an extension. If there's a resourcepack.json, it's a resource pack.

2. Choose which tab fits the mod you are trying to install.
